## This is my project for the task using Unity Gaming Services.
### I have successfully implemented Relay Server and Lobby.
Unfortunately I couldn't make it to work with second player, while using Relay Server, but was able to do so locally.
### I have also setup dedicated server in Unity Cloud with build and Fleet. Example shown in the image below.

For Matchmaker

However, this is where the project stands at.
I want to show you with some images of the project:
